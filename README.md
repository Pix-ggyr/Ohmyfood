Once your Sass is correctly installed (you can check by typing : `sass --version` in your terminal) you will need to add this line to your package.json file into scripts section :

```json
"scripts": {
    "sass": "sass --watch ./sass/main.scss:./public/css/style.css"
  },
```

Then, all you have to do is launch Sass compilation while editing your code as it follows :

`npm run sass`

Ok, now you're go to go !
